# Description
Wuuurms is a cross-platform application to host a boardgame event.

# Technical
V1: Uses Flutter and AWS Amplify with GraphQL. Infrastructure will be managed with CDK but initial Amplify is used where possible to speed up development.

V2: Will use Flutter but create the backend and infrastructure entirely with CDK and move to A Rest API instead of GraphQL.

# Philosophy
The goal of this project is to learn new skills and technologies. It take inspiration from another board game event application I have co-developed: https://www.hexgames.be. The name "Wuuurms" is derived from a game named "Regenwormen" (translates to "Earthworms").
