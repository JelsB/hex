# Description
This document describes the development process. This is useful to figure out what I have learnt and to store and share knowledge later.

# Initialisation
This assumes a local development setup with Flutter is already present. This starts from the [full stack Flutter tutorial of Amplify](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/flutter/).

## First steps

1. `mkdir infra`
2. `cd infra`
3. `cdk init --language=python`
4. `cd -`
5. `flutter create app`

## Some testing
1. `cd app`
2. `flutter run`
   1.  shows linux and chrome automatically detected options
   2.   Enable debug mode on phone (click build status 7 times + enable it). Plug in phone. `flutter run` automatically builds and opens app on phone.

## Next steps
1. Add amplify packages
   1. add to pubspec.yaml
   2. run `flutter pub get`
2. Update platform configurations
   1. android
3. `amplify init`
   1. Select CloudFormation
   2. Select profile with `AdministratorAccess-Amplify` policy permission
   3. If you can an error `You have reached the Amplify App limit for this account and region`. Delete all amplify apps and try again.
   4. Deploys a CloudFormation stack
      1.  2 IAM roles
      2.  S3 bucket
   5. Deploys an Amplify application
   6. Creates `amplify/` folder
      1. `team-provider-info.json` contains info about CloudFormation stacks and its resources
      2. a bunch of files/folders that should not be version controlled (see `.gitignore`)
   7. `amplify add api`
      1. select GraphQL
      2. Select AWS Incognito for authorisation
         1. Use default configuration
         2. Login with Username
      3. This updates `amplify/backend/backend-config.json` file with login configuration
      4. This creates `amplifybackend/auth/<app_name_suffix` folder with `cli-inputs.json` file which contains Congnito configuration.
      5. Enter `N` when prompted to Configure additional auth types
      6. Select Continue
      7. Add blank schema
      8. Select Y to edit schema
         ```
         type BudgetEntry @model @auth(rules: [{ allow: owner }]) {
         id: ID!
         title: String!
         description: String
         amount: Float!
         }
         ```
      9. `amplify push`
         1.  Updates existing stack with lambda function, role, and custom resource + 2 nested stacks
         2.  First nested stack: auth/cognito related resources
         3.  Second nested stack: AppSync GraphQL api, schema and Datasource + 2 more nested stacks
             1.  First nested stack: AppSync resolvers and function configurations
             2.  Second nested stack: empty
         4.  It returns your GraphQL endpoint and transform version
      10. `amplify codegen models` creates Dart model files based on GraphQL schema  
4.  Add `go_router` package
5.  run `flutter pub get` or VScode does this automatically on saving the `pubspec.yaml` file when Flutter extension is installed.
6.  Replace `main.dart` file with tutorial example
7.  Connect with Amplify auth and api backend services
    1.  Add `auth` (Cognitor) and `api` (GraphQL)
    2.  Replace some code in `main.dart` to configure amplify resources on start-up
8.  run `flutter run`
    1.  Login screen appears before app can be used![Login screen at start-up of app](images/login.png)
    2.  Creating real users with real emails/verification/password etc works out of the box due to Cognito!
        1. Create user `Jels` with fake email address
        2. Create second user `Jels` with real email address
        3. This fails because we choose that usernames have to be unique. The previous user is already stored in Cognito![User Jels with fake email in Cognito](images/cognito_user_jels_fake_email.png)
        4. Manually delete fake user in Cognito
        5. Again create user `Jels` with real email address
        6. Out of the box, it sends verification email with code
        7. Enter received code
        8. You now enter the app's home screen
 9. Add new screen to enter budgets
    1.  Add new class
    2.  Add new route that instantiates this class screen
    3.  Go to this page when pressing `+` button
    4.  `flutter run`
    5.  Press `+` button after login
    6.  Enter budget details
        1.  title: `Test1`
        2.  description:  `some tst`
        3.  amount: `2`
    7.  Submit form
    8.  We are returned to home screen but don't see our newly created budget. It did, however, get created in DynamoDB![item in DynamoDB table with details of newly created budget](images/DDB_first_budget.png)
9.  Show list of budgets on start-up and update when creating new one
    1.  add methos to query the items
    2.  call this method on start-up and after creating new budget
10. Delete items
    1.  add delete GraphQL mutation method
    2.  when swiping away an item, call delete item method
    3.  refresh list after doing that

**This is where the tutorial ends**
## Platform configuration updates
See docs for all platforms: https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/setup/q/integration/flutter/#platform-setup
### Android
Amplify requires a minimum of API level 24 (Android 7.0), Gradle 7 and Kotlin > 1.7 when targeting Android.

From your project root, navigate to the android/ directory and open build.gradle in the text editor of your choice. Update the Gradle plugin version to 7.4.2 or higher:
```
dependencies {
-       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.2.0'
+       classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.4.2'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
``` 
If your Kotlin Gradle plugin version is below 1.7, update android/build.gradle:
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'
```
Then, open android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties. Update the Gradle distributionUrl to a version between 7.3 and 7.6.1 (see the Flutter docs for more info).
```
-distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0-all.zip
+distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6.1-all.zip
```
Then, open android/app/build.gradle. Update the minimum Android SDK version to 24 or higher:
```
defaultConfig {
        // TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
        applicationId "com.example.myapp"
        // You can update the following values to match your application needs.
        // For more information, see: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#reviewing-the-gradle-build-configuration.
-       minSdkVersion flutter.minSdkVersion
+       minSdkVersion 24
        targetSdkVersion flutter.targetSdkVersion
        versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName flutterVersionName
    }
```

# Beyond initial steps
From now on, we build our own application. We do no start from scratch but will adapt the current application we have.

## Add login to specific pages
Instead of adding the login when entering the app/site, it is desirable to already see public information. Login should therefore be an explicit action which shows personal information to the user.

First idea was to call the authenticator after going to the login page but the `Authenticator` component already has the built-in functionality to limit authentication to certain pages. See [the docs](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/flutter/connected-components/authenticator/customization).

1. We add another route `/login` which requires authentication. Other current routes are public.
> **What have I learnt?** 
> - Routes don't update with *hot reload*. You need to restart the application.
> - `Authenticator` component does not work on Desktop
> - Specific screens for authentication doens't work with `Authenticator`'s `builder` config 

## Add new table
Adding a new DDB table to store boardgames.
1. Manually create new schmema in `amplify/backend/api/hex/schema.graphql`
   1. Start with public one
      ```graphql
      type BoardGame @model {
         id: ID!
         name: String!
         description: String!
         minimumNumberOfPlayers: Int!
         maximumNumberOfPlayers: Int
         minimumDuration: Int!
         maximumDuration: Int
         }
      ```
   2. Run `amplify push`. It will fetch the cloud environment and update resources when needed. Iill show which Cfn stacks will be updated. Here, it wil update the api stack. It will create new resources for our new model.
   3. Run `amplify codegen models` to create the actual models in `lib/models`.
   4. Adapt schema by adding a field with a restricted set of values via an `enum`
      ```
      enum BoardGameType {
         CO_OP,
         WORKER_PLACEMENT
      }

      type BoardGame @model {
         id: ID!
         name: String!
         description: String!
         minimumNumberOfPlayers: Int!
         maximumNumberOfPlayers: Int
         minimumDuration: Int!
         maximumDuration: Int
         type: BoardGameType!
      }
      ```
   5. Run `amplify codegen models` (it can be run before `amplify push`)
   6. Run `amplify push`

> **What have I learnt?** 
> - schema keys cannot contain `-`. Must begin with a letter (`a-z` or `A-Z`) or an underscore (`_`). Names cannot start with a number or any other character.  Following the initial character, names can contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and underscores (`_`). Other special characters or symbols are not allowed. It can result in obscure errors on `amplify push`: 
> "There was an error pulling the backend environment dev.
ðŸ›‘ Syntax Error: Invalid number, expected digit but got: "O".
