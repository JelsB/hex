# Reason a Python version is on hold
The [Amplify Graphql API Construct](https://constructs.dev/packages/@aws-amplify/graphql-api-construct/v/1.5.3?lang=typescript) package is currently only available in Typescript.
This is useful to autogenerate GraphQL Resolvers.
There is an open [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-category-api/issues/2146) for the Python version.
