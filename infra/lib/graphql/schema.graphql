  # The state type will be different per type of badge but polymorphism
  # is not supported with the @model directive.
  # This would create a table per badge type, which is overkill.
  # The alternative to this, would be to include this into the player object
  # with a field per badge type.
  # Not sure yet which approach is better.
  # The current moves logic into the resolvers when updating the state, needing
  # to convert the state to the correct type based on the badge type.
  # The alternative makes it slightly easier to know the state type.
  # Because this will need a custom Lambda resolver any way, I don't think it matters.
  # This is a field that the client should not use directly.
